Title: Video Game Sales Predictor Application
Purpose: The purpose of this application is to use a trained linear regression model to predict Global Sales values for video games using factors like Critic Score, User Score, Critic Count, and User Count from a CSV file. Graphs showcasing the data are also utilized.

Environment: JupyterLab
Python Version: Python 3.10.4
CSV File Source: CSV File used in the application created by Kendall Gillies, retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kendallgillies/video-game-sales-and-ratings

Directions: The application uses the JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook environment to run locally. Use the following steps to run the Global Sales Predictor application:

1.	Visit https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution and download Anaconda.
2.	Install Anaconda on your machine. This should download most of the appropriate libraries you need automatically like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and ipywidgets.
3.	Next, install Voila to view the application in a dashboard. Open the Anaconda navigator application and run CMD.exe Prompt from the Anaconda navigator home.
4.	Type “conda install -c conda-forge voila” into the CMD.exe console. Hit enter and download Voila.
5.	Once Voila is successfully installed, open either JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook from the home menu in the Anaconda navigator.
6.	If the user is using JupyterLab, go to step 7. If the user is using Jupyter Notebook, go to step 11.


7.	Steps 7-10 are for users using JupyterLab. Open the file in JupyterLab from the left side of the application.
8.	Once the file is open in JupyterLab, select the Voila dashboard button on the taskbar.
9.	Give the application a few moments to start the dashboard. The dashboard will be generated along with the graphs.
10.	Scroll down to use the Prediction Application. The user can plug in numbers for Critic Score, User Score, Critic Count, and User Count. Once you have plugged in the values you wish to predict with, click the Predict button to generate a predicted Global Sales value using the trained linear regression model.


11.	Steps 11-15 are for users using Jupyter Notebook. Open the relevant folder in Jupyter Notebook with the application files.
12.	Click on VideoGameSalesPredictorApp.ipynb to open the file in Jupyter Notebook.
13.	Once the application file is opened in Jupyter Notebook, select the Voila button.
14.	Give the application a few moments to start the dashboard. The dashboard will be generated along with the graphs.
15.	Scroll down to use the Prediction Application. The user can plug in numbers for Critic Score, User Score, Critic Count, and User Count. Once you have plugged in the values you wish to predict with, click the Predict button to generate a predicted Global Sales value using the trained linear regression model.
